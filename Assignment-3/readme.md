GAN_CIFAR100.py:

Use GAN network to generate new images using Cifar100 dataset and Obtain the generated new images(The new generated images should be similar to the original images)<br/>I have trained this model for 200 epoch and after each 10 epoch,images are generated and stored in different folder.<br />
Also, Generated model will be saved after each 10 epoch. 

<br/><b>Output:</b><br />
Generated images after 10 epoch-<br /> ![Generated images after 10 epoch](https://github.com/BirvaPatel/Deep-Learning/blob/main/Assignment-3/generated_plot_e10.png)
Generated images after 100 epoch-<br /> ![Generated images after 100 epoch](https://github.com/BirvaPatel/Deep-Learning/blob/main/Assignment-3/generated_plot_e100.png)

LSTM_DIS.py:<br/>

LSTM for time serious problem recognition. Here I have used Disneyland stock(DIS) price dataset.
